## Usage 
AS A user, I want to be able to write and save notes. 
I also want to be able to delete notes I've written before, SO that I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete.
It's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.
